I am a 2nd year Ph.D student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/) at University of Washington. Driven by potential applications in clinical problems, I'm excited about tackling medical image analysis with computer vision and machine learning techniques.

I received my bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University in 2019. As an undergraduate research assistant, I was fortunated to work with [Weibei Dou](http://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/3784/2010/20101219112256451106093/20101219112256451106093_.html) and [Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). I also worked as a research intern in [Li Lab](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/research/labs/li.html) at UCLA in the summer of 2018.
